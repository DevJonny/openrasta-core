OpenRasta hosted in ASP.NET
========================

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/t5to54i73n21wmv5)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/holytshirt/openrasta-hosting-aspnet)

This allows OpenRasta to be host within ASP.NET.
All you need to do is create a empty ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC project, or use an existing one, and install the NuGet package.

# Installation

We recommended installing [the NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/openrasta-hosting-aspnet "openrasta-hosting-aspnet"). 

Install on the command line from your project directory:

```bash
cmd> nuget install openrasta-hosting-aspnet -Pre
```

Or use the Package Manager console in Visual Studio with the correct project:

```powershell
PM> Install-Package openrasta-hosting-aspnet -Pre
```
