OpenRasta hosted in ASP.NET
========================

This allows OpenRasta to be host within ASP.NET, so all you need to do is create a empty ASP.NET orASP.NET MVC project or use an existing one and install the NuGet package.

# Installation

We recommended installing [the NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/openrasta-hosting-aspnet "openrasta-hosting-aspnet"). 

Install on the command line from your project directory:

```bash
cmd> nuget install openrasta-hosting-aspnet -Pre
```

Or use the Package Manager console in Visual Studio with the correct project:

```powershell
PM> Install-Package openrasta-hosting-aspnet -Pre
```
